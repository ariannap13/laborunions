Costa spoke about his career at the ATU that began at NJ Transit, with ATU Local 819 in Newark, NJ. After serving his Local in various capacities, he was elected President before moving on to become Chair of the ATU New Jersey State Joint Council and then ATU International Vice President, and ultimately International President.

The challenges faced by officers can vary widely, ranging from negotiating with management to handling internal conflicts, Local finances or addressing the needs and concerns of members. These challenges often require a diverse set of skills, including effective communication, negotiation, problem-solving, and decision-making. New officers will learn these critical skills this week to build the necessary foundation to best serve their Locals, their members, and our Union.

Joining Costa were International Executive Vice President Yvette Trujillo, and International Secretary-Treasurer Ken Kirk.

Its attempt to defeat a pro-worker insurgent campaign for seats on its Board of Directors alone seems to be costing a small fortune. But that enormous war chest has failed to stop workers: just last week, twenty-one stores filed with the NLRB for union elections, the largest number of single-day filings since the campaign began.

Wright, whom NATCA President Paul Rinaldi called ‚Äúa NATCA treasure,‚Äù was presented with the Union‚Äôs highest honor, the John Thornton Award, which is given in recognition of extraordinary contributions that have significantly changed the course of NATCA‚Äôs history.

Wright first began his career in the Air Force, working at Berlin Center in Germany and England Air Force Base in Louisiana before joining the FAA in 1983 in Atlanta. He spent the majority of his air traffic career in Charlotte before retiring from the FAA in 2007 and accepting a position at NATCA as the Director of Safety and Technology.

The John Thornton Award, said NATCA Executive Vice President Trish Gilbert, honors a select few individuals who, ‚Äúhad they not been a part of NATCA and our profession, and committed to our workforce and the system, we would not be where we are today. Dale Wright is one of those individuals.‚Äù

The training brought together a diverse group of NATCA members and representatives, all dedicated to upholding the highest standards of conduct within the profession. Through the program, attendees were equipped with vital interpersonal tools to effectively address and resolve workplace issues, foster a positive work environment, and enhance teamwork.

Veronica Torres (Greensboro ATCT, GSO) serves as the PSC Charlotte District Chair, and emphasized the program's positive effect: ""The Professional Standards Program helps inspire peers within our profession to maintain a high bar for professionalism, keeps issues at the lowest levels, and also provides second chances for people to learn and grow.""

1231433498135050,"Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was a social activist and Baptist minister who played a leading role in the American civil rights movement from the mid-1950s until his assassination in 1968. He was an inspirational proponent of organized, nonviolent resistance. Dr. King sought equality and human rights for African Americans and all victims of injustice through peaceful protest. Later during his career, he expanded his activism ‚Äì with the Poor People‚Äôs Campaign ‚Äì to include economic issues such as opposing poverty and advocating for workplace collective action and union organizing.

As we all witnessed the ugly attack on the Capitol just two weeks ago, we reflect on Dr. King‚Äôs legacy of nonviolence and his impassioned call to pursue social justice. Social justice promotes fairness and equity across all aspects of society. It is about transforming unjust and violent social orders and relationships through consciousness-raising, systematic organizing, and mobilizing those who are marginalized and oppressed politically, economically, ecologically, and socially.

The solidarity of our great Union aligns with Dr. King‚Äôs important legacy. We are proud of NATCA members and the projects they have participated in over the past year to make our Union more inclusive and fight injustices that continue to harm our society. 

In the spirit of Dr. King, the members of NATCA join together to advocate for fair wages and benefits. Our Union‚Äôs legislative activists are well known for our advocacy on behalf of our more than 20,000 bargaining unit employees, as well as for all aviation safety specialists, to all 535 Congressional representatives. Dr. King‚Äôs final speech, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Been to the Mountaintop,‚Äù known for its poetic narrative about having ‚Äúseen the Promised Land,‚Äù was given to striking sanitation workers in Memphis, Tenn. Dr. King remarked, ‚Äúlet us keep the issues where they are. The issue is injustice. The issue is the refusal of Memphis to be fair and honest in its dealings with its public servants, who happen to be sanitation workers. Now we've got to keep attention on that.‚Äù

NATCA members also join together to advocate for the working conditions necessary to maintain a safe National Airspace System. During the last year, as we have faced this horrible pandemic, we have been so proud to see members taking care of themselves, supporting their brothers and sisters in NATCA and other unions, and helping others working to keep their local communities and our nation safe.

Together, we have the power to overcome other challenges. We must continue in his legacy, to be undaunted in our pursuit of equal justice for all. As we reflect on the life and legacy of Dr. King, let us not forget the compassion he showed to others, no matter their differences. #MLK #MLKday",1,1,0,1,0,0

NATCA Grateful To President Biden For Revoking Former President‚Äôs Anti-Worker, Anti-Union Executive Orders

WASHINGTON ‚Äì The National Air Traffic Controllers Association today expressed its relief and also its gratitude to President Joe Biden for restoring many critical federal employee protections and union rights in the federal government by revoking three 2018 executive orders (EOs) issued by former President Donald Trump. Those EOs significantly threatened NATCA members‚Äô rights as federal employees, NATCA‚Äôs collective bargaining agreements (CBAs), and NATCA‚Äôs ability as a union to represent its members.

NATCA today joined a coalition of 22 aviation union and industry groups in sending a letter to the governors of the 50 U.S. states and five populated territories urging them to prioritize frontline aviation workers for allocation of the COVID-19 vaccine in their state‚Äôs upcoming vaccination implementation plans.

The letters explain how aviation workers are vulnerable and why we need to be prioritized. ‚ÄúAviation workers are frontline workers who either encounter the traveling public frequently or are required to perform our work in close proximity to our colleagues and perform our jobs onsite.‚Äù 

As our country begins to distribute vaccines, ‚Äúthe U.S. will need every asset available to perform optimally ‚Äî including the frontline workers that keep our nation‚Äôs safe and efficient air transportation and supply chain systems operational,‚Äù the letter continued. ""Air transportation will be essential to fight back against the virus and return to normal, even if it is a new normal. As crewmembers, machinists, air traffic controllers, customer service representatives, airport workers, and recognizing other government frontline partners in the FAA, TSA, and CBP, we stand ready to carry the vaccines, medical supplies and healthcare professionals that will help our nation defeat this virus, giving us hope for a healthy future and full economic recovery.""

5.35141E+14,"Statement by NATCA President Paul Rinaldi about President‚Äôs 2018 Budget Proposal

WASHINGTON ‚Äì NATCA will carefully evaluate the President‚Äôs proposal. For us to consider supporting any reform proposal, it must meet our core principles: 

1. Protecting the men and women who ensure the safety and efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS) in their employment relationship, including their rights and benefits; 
2. Ensuring that safety and efficiency remain the top priorities; 
3. Providing a stable, predictable funding stream that adequately supports air traffic control services, staffing, hiring and training, long-term modernization, preventative maintenance, and ongoing modernization of the physical infrastructure; and
4. Ensuring continued service to all segments of our nation‚Äôs diverse aviation community. 

NATCA opposes operating the NAS based on a profit motive. We also oppose any proposal that would maintain the unstable, unpredictable status quo.

As the Administration and Congress consider air traffic control reform and work to provide long-term reauthorization for the FAA, and therefore address the problem of stop-and-go funding, it is important that all stakeholders within the NAS collaborate to ensure that the United States remains the world leader in aviation.  We are encouraged that a discussion on the future of aviation and the NAS is a national priority.

NATCA will continue to seek to be part of the solution to the problems caused by an unstable, unpredictable funding stream. We will continue to ensure the safety of the NAS and protect the men and women who safeguard it, both today and in the future.

On background: NATCA supported the Aviation Innovation, Reform & Reauthorization (AIRR) Act of 2016, because it met these core principles.

5.29693E+14,"""Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said Wednesday that he spoke with Vice President Pence about how the White House can implement on a federal level parts of the Republican governor's contentious policy that all-but eliminated collective bargaining for public sector unions in the state.

""President Trump has talked about wanting to weaken collective bargaining protections for federal employees, most of whom can't currently bargain over wages or benefits, to make it easier to hire and fire government workers and base pay on merit rather than tenure. Those changes would require an act of Congress.

""Walker severely restricted union power in Wisconsin and is now talking with the Trump administration about ""how they may take bits and pieces of what we did"" with the union law and civil service reform and ""apply it at the national level.""

""""It's something the vice president has brought up before,"" Walker told reporters following a speech in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. ""It's certainly something we're willing to offer our assistance on, particularly if it helps not just the nation, but in turn improves our ability to be better stewards of the taxpayers here in Wisconsin.""""

1273146290496330,"Dear Brothers and Sisters,

The U.S. House of Representatives earlier today passed three pieces of legislation that are important to NATCA members and the United States aviation system.

First, the U.S House of Representatives passed H.R. 302, which is a bipartisan five-year Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill. The passage of this bill takes us another step closer to securing longer-term stability for the FAA. The FAA bill now goes to the U.S. Senate for consideration, where the timing is unclear due to the Senate‚Äôs packed legislative calendar this week. If the Senate is unable to pass the FAA reauthorization bill by midnight on Sunday, Sept. 30, another extension will be necessary to avoid an Agency shutdown.

That is why the House also passed a short-term FAA authorization extension through Oct. 7, which the Senate is expected to approve later this evening or tomorrow. This extension will provide the Senate more time, if needed, to pass the five-year reauthorization bill and allow the Agency to continue to operate if H.R. 302 is not enacted into law before the deadline. 

In addition to acting on FAA Reauthorization legislation today, the House also voted to prevent a partial government shutdown due to a lapse in appropriations beginning on Oct. 1. The House passed an appropriations bill that would fund the departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education for a full year, combined with a short-term Continuing Resolution (CR) to keep the rest of the government ‚Äì including the FAA ‚Äì running through Dec. 7. The Senate already has acted on this legislation, so it will now be sent to the President, who already has signaled his support, for signature. The CR will prevent a partial shutdown of the government, including the FAA and other agencies that have not received full-year funding.

NATCA applauds Rep. Bill Shuster, R-Pa., Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-N.J., and Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Wash. for advancing the FAA reauthorization bill in the House. Enactment of this legislation and the CR are crucially important, and NATCA is advocating for the passage of both. We will continue to keep you updated as we approach these Sept. 30 deadlines for FAA authorization and government-wide funding.

In solidarity,

Paul Rinaldi, President

1080599483445224,"NATCA is relieved to avoid another devastating government shutdown. The recent 35-day shutdown was damaging to the lives of air traffic controllers and other aviation safety professionals represented by NATCA. The prolonged government shutdown eroded the layers of safety in the National Airspace System (NAS). The NAS is less safe now than it was before the shutdown began.
 
 The shutdown reinforced our strong belief that the status quo is broken. The constant funding crises that arise from a stop-and-go funding stream continue to wreak havoc on our system and perpetuate the current staffing crisis. The NAS requires a stable, predictable funding stream in order to adequately support air traffic control services, staffing, hiring and training, long-term modernization projects, preventative maintenance, ongoing modernization to the physical infrastructure, integration of new entrants, and the timely implementation of NextGen modernization projects. 
 
 To that end, NATCA turns our full attention to the passage of the Aviation Funding Stability Act of 2019, HR 1108. With its passage, in the event of a government shutdown, all FAA projects, programs, and activities that were previously funded would continue to be funded out of the Airport & Airway Trust Fund. This legislation will prevent future government shutdowns from forcing FAA to furlough aviation safety professionals, reducing the safety of the system. It will also prevent government shutdowns from delaying the implementation of critical safety programs. NATCA urges everyone concerned about aviation safety to join us in supporting this legislation.
