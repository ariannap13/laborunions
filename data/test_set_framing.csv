The training brought together a diverse group of NATCA members and representatives, all dedicated to upholding the highest standards of conduct within the profession. Through the program, attendees were equipped with vital interpersonal tools to effectively address and resolve workplace issues, foster a positive work environment, and enhance teamwork.

Veronica Torres (Greensboro ATCT, GSO) serves as the PSC Charlotte District Chair, and emphasized the program's positive effect: ""The Professional Standards Program helps inspire peers within our profession to maintain a high bar for professionalism, keeps issues at the lowest levels, and also provides second chances for people to learn and grow."" She highlighted the importance of the training in inspiring attendees to conduct themselves with integrity and excellence.

Andrew Commons (Kahului ATCT, OGG) shared his appreciation for the training's practical benefits: ""The Professional Standards Committee member training was useful in providing the interpersonal tools for me to help my facility,"" Commons said. ‚ÄúIt was uplifting to see how many people across the Agency share my passion for a healthy work environment and are willing to put in the work to maintain that.""

The event was led by the PSC team of experienced instructorsLydia Baune (Spokane ATCT, GEG), Patrick Carter (Dallas/Fort Worth TRACON, D10), and Chris Keyes (Washington Center, ZDC), who collectively brought a wealth of knowledge and expertise to the training sessions.

So why is Starbucks raising the white flag?

We can‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in the minds of its executives, but a few factors stand out. An analysis from the Strategic Organizing Center estimates that the company has spent some $240 million on union busting. Its attempt to defeat a pro-worker insurgent campaign for seats on its Board of Directors alone seems to be costing a small fortune. But that enormous war chest has failed to stop workers: just last week, twenty-one stores filed with the NLRB for union elections, the largest number of single-day filings since the campaign began.
